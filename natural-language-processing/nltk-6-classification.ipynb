For example, the classifier learns that a word is likely to be a noun if it comes immediately after the word \"large\" or the word \"gubernatorial\". However, it is unable to learn the generalization that a word is probably a noun if it follows an adjective, because it doesn't have access to the previous word's part-of-speech tag. In general, simple classifiers always treat each input as independent from all other inputs. In many contexts, this makes perfect sense. For example, decisions about whether names tend to be male or female can be made on a case-by-case basis.

    "In order to capture the dependencies between related classification tasks, we can use joint classifier models, which choose an appropriate labeling for a collection of related inputs. In the case of part-of-speech tagging, a variety of different sequence classifier models can be used to jointly choose part-of-speech tags for all the words in a given sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "One sequence classification strategy, known as consecutive classification or greedy sequence classification, is to find the most likely class label for the first input, then to use that answer to help find the best label for the next input. The process can then be repeated until all of the inputs have been labeled. This is the approach that was taken by the bigram tagger, which began by choosing a part-of-speech tag for the first word in the sentence, and then chose the tag for each subsequent word based on the word itself and the predicted tag for the previous word.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must augment our feature extractor function to take a history argument, which provides a list of the tags that we've predicted for the sentence so far. Each tag in history corresponds with a word in sentence. But note that history will only contain tags for words we've already classified, that is, words to the left of the target word. Thus, while it is possible to look at some features of words to the right of the target word, it is not possible to look at the tags for those words (since we haven't generated them yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Having defined a feature extractor, we can proceed to build our sequence classifier. During training, we use the annotated tags to provide the appropriate history to the feature extractor, but when tagging new sentences, we generate the history list based on the output of the tagger itself."

Evaluation can also be an effective tool for guiding us in making future improvements to the model.\n",

For classification tasks that have a small number of well-balanced labels and a diverse test set, a meaningful evaluation can be performed with as few as 100 evaluation instances. But if a classification task has a large number of labels, or includes very infrequent labels, then the size of the test set should be chosen to ensure that the least frequent label occurs at least 50 times. Additionally, if the test set contains many closely related instances — such as instances drawn from a single document — then the size of the test set should be increased to ensure that this lack of diversity does not skew the evaluation results. When large amounts of annotated data are available, it is common to err on the side of safety by using 10% of the overall data for evaluation.\n",
